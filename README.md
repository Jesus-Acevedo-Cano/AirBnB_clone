# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

## Description
Web application that simulates some of the features of Airbnb for academic purposes.

In this moment we are the first part "the console"
The console is a way of using the typical functionalities of an administrative panel (for example CRUD) but without a graphical interface because, as its name implies, it is done from a command console.

## Prerequisites üìã

64-bit system , Ubuntu 

## Objectives

### Console

-   Create your data model
-   Manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
-   Store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)

### Web Static
-   learn HTML/CSS
-   create the HTML of your application
-   create template of each objec

### MySQL storage
-   replace the file storage by a Database storage
-   map your models to a table in database by using an O.R.M.

### MySQL storage
-   replace the file storage by a Database storage
-   map your models to a table in database by using an O.R.M.

### Web framework - templating
-   create your first web server in Python
-   make your static HTML file dynamic by using objects stored in a file or database

### RESTful API
-   expose all your objects stored via a JSON web interface
-   manipulate your objects via a RESTful API

### Web dynamic

-   learn JQuery
-   load objects from the client side by using your own RESTful API

## Console

The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between ‚ÄúMy object‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow they are stored and persisted‚Äù. This means: from your console code (the command interpreter itself) and from the front-end and RestAPI you will build later, you won‚Äôt have to pay attention (take care) of how your objects are stored.

This abstraction will also allow you to change the type of storage easily without updating all of your codebase.

The console will be a tool to validate this storage engine

### How to start the console?
`./console.py`
